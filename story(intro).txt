The world you live in, consists of 6 kingdoms. However the Kingdom, Dragon Spine has been overtaken by the Evil Dragon which threatens to rule over the world.
Your aim is to gain enough attributes and levels to finally face the Evil Dragon boss. 


To put your fighting skills to a test, we present you this experimental monster.
